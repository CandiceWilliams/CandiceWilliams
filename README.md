Hello! :smile:	 My name is Candice Williams and I am currently in my last year of pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science at Western University (a.k.a the Univeristy of Western Ontario) in London, Ontario. 

I am interested in Web Development (front and backend) :computer:, Artficial Intelligence and Machine Learning :mechanical_arm:	, and Computer Networking :gear:	. I am very enthusiastic about technology and software development and hope to be able to contribute to many projects in the future.

:woman_technologist: In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels and comics, cooking for my friends and family, and applying my university curriculum into practice by creating new and exciting projects that test my understanding. 

I have been coding since 2018 when I was in grade 10 and since then, I have developed a passion for Computer Science that has only continued to grow over the years. It is my hope that, as I continue my journey, I meet more intelligent and talented programmers so that I may learn from them and improve my skills. 

I am proficent in Java, C, C++, Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React and Unity scripting. I hope to expand my knowledge further in these topics as well as learn new languages and frameworks in the future!

Please reach out to me if you would like to connect. Cheers! :hugs:
